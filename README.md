In this project, I utilized the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) to thoroughly verify a 4-bit Adder design. The verification process involved establishing a well-organized project structure, which included the development of an Interface module and an "add" module integrated into the Design Under Test (DUT).

UVM, a widely-recognized methodology for validating digital designs, was selected to create a robust and structured testbench. The Interface module acted as a vital intermediary, facilitating seamless data exchange between the DUT and the Verification Environment.

The "add" module handled the core combinatorial logic responsible for executing addition within the 4-bit Adder.

Ensuring a clear connection between the Interface module and the DUT, and its smooth integration into the broader Verification Environment, played a critical role in scrutinizing the behavior of the Combinational Adder. This approach guaranteed the design's compliance with functional requirements and alignment with industry-standard verification practices.By harnessing UVM and following this well-structured approach, the project successfully achieved comprehensive validation of the 4-bit Adder's functionality, highlighting the systematic nature of the verification process.
